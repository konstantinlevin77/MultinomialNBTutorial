Naive Bayes is a powerful classification algorithm.
1. It's based on probabilities and not hard to interpret
2. It's fast. 
3. It's computation cost is low which makes it possible to use as an online algorithm. 
    You can always add a few new samples once in a while and update probabilities. It doesn't involve a complex training phase.

And what I like about it as a junior, it's actually one of the easiest algorithms to grasp. Everything makes sense and feels intuitive. So come and join me in this adventure and discover the Naive Bayes Classifier :) Everything is detailly explained, hope you enjoy!
